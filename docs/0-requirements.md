# Project Requirements

## Identified Problem or Need

When doing pottery you can glaze the thing you made (piece). Putting more of a glaze on can give different affects. This can also be changed
by combining glazes, for example, putting 2 layers of red on and 2 layers of black on. This can be difficult to track as you must leave a glaze for a while before
adding another layer. This means you can forget how many layers have been completed leading to affects that you didn't want. 


## End-User Requirements

Able to track pottery piece progress (how many glazes done, how many till complete). Add more pieces to the DB as well as glazes owned. 

## Proposed Solution

Make a website that uses a DB that holds information about what glazes owned and what pieces made that tracks how close a piece is to being complete.

### Impact / Considerations

To achieve using this implication effectively i will need to get feedback from my end-user about how and where they want the navigation bars to work and where they are placed on the page. 



## Functionality Implications

Functionality implications refer to how particular features effect the overall usefulness and effectiveness on the system.  

### Relevance to the System

Functionality implications will help my end user use my website to fulfil its intended purpose without getting confused or having overcomplicated steps to achieve something.

### Impact / Considerations

To use Functionality implications across my website i need to consider how my end user will want to navigate the website and interact with my DB 



## Aesthetic Implications 

Aesthetic implications refer to how the design of the website looks. The use of colours that work well together, font/font size, 

### Relevance to the System

Aesthetic implication is relevant to the system because the aesthetics affects how the users experience is shaped. Having clear colours on buttons, like white on black instead of light blue on dark blue makes them easy to see. 

### Impact / Considerations

To make sure that my end user can clearly make their way around my website, ill need to use contrasting colours that work well together. 



## End-User Implications

The website is connected to solving the issues of your end user. 

### Relevance to the System

End-User Implications is relevant to the system because the website is based around the user and what they want in the first place. This makes it logical to listen to them and how they want the website to be layed out. 

### Impact / Considerations

Considering that the website is for the sole purpose of fulfilling what the end user wants, getting feedback along the way will help me to satisfy the end users desires for the website. 



## Accessibility Implications

Accessibility Implications means that my website is available across platforms and to all end users. 

### Relevance to the System

Accessibility Implications is relevant to the system because it allows the website to be accessible to more people. 

### Impact / Considerations

Since my website will only be used by one person. I will need to consider all the systems that it might be used on (phone, ipad and computer)
