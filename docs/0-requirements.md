# Project Requirements

## Identified Problem or Need

When doing pottery you can glaze the thing you made (piece). Putting more of a glaze on can give different affects. This can also be changed
by combining glazes, for example, putting 2 layers of red on and 2 layers of black on. This can be difficult to track as you must leave a glaze for a while before
adding another layer. This means you can forget how many layers have been completed leading to affects that you didn't want.
