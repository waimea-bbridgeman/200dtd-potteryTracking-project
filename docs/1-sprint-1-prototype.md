# Sprint 1 - A Working UI Prototype


## Sprint Goals

Develop a prototype that simulates the key functionality of the system, then test and refine it so that it can serve as the model for the next phase of development in Sprint 2.

[Figma](https://www.figma.com/) is used to develop the prototype.

## Initial Database Design

My database has a many to many relationship using the 'uses' table as a middle man

## UI 'Flow'

The first stage of prototyping was to explore how the UI might 'flow' between states, based on the required functionality.

This Figma demo shows the initial design for the UI 'flow':

### Testing

Giving my prototype to my end-user this was some feedback that was raised: 
> There is no way to cancel adding a piece or glaze so maybe add a cancel button or home button somewhere

> Photo of the piece before and after being glazed

> Date of when piece was started/completed 


### Changes / Improvements

Replace this text with notes any improvements you made as a result of the testing.

## Initial Database Design

After the talks with my end-user, their comment about having the date of when the piece was added to the database required me to change
my drawSQL prototype.

## Initial UI Prototype

The next stage of prototyping was to develop the layout for each screen of the UI.

This Figma demo shows the initial layout design for the UI:

*FIGMA PROTOTYPE - PLACE THE FIGMA EMBED CODE HERE - MAKE SURE IT IS SET SO THAT EVERYONE CAN ACCESS IT*

### Testing

Giving my prototype to my end-user this was some feedback that was raised: 
> Increase the amount of glazes that can be added to 7 or so 

> Add the total amount of layers to be done 

### Changes / Improvements

Replace this text with notes any improvements you made as a result of the testing.

*FIGMA IMPROVED PROTOTYPE - PLACE THE FIGMA EMBED CODE HERE - MAKE SURE IT IS SET SO THAT EVERYONE CAN ACCESS IT*

## Refined UI Prototype

Having established the layout of the UI screens, the prototype was refined visually, in terms of colour, fonts, etc.

This Figma demo shows the UI with refinements applied:

*FIGMA REFINED PROTOTYPE - PLACE THE FIGMA EMBED CODE HERE - MAKE SURE IT IS SET SO THAT EVERYONE CAN ACCESS IT*

### Testing

Replace this text with notes about what you did to test the UI flow and the outcome of the testing.

### Changes / Improvements

Replace this text with notes any improvements you made as a result of the testing.

*FIGMA IMPROVED REFINED PROTOTYPE - PLACE THE FIGMA EMBED CODE HERE - MAKE SURE IT IS SET SO THAT EVERYONE CAN ACCESS IT*

## Sprint Review

Replace this text with a statement about how the sprint has moved the project forward - key success point, any things that didn't go so well, etc.
