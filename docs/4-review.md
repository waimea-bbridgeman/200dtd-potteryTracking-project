# Project Review

## Addressing Relevant Implications

## End-User Requirements


To be able to track how many layers have been completed as well as glazes and pieces I made two forms to add glazes and pieces to the database. Then you can find a piece on the home screen and then add a glaze layer to the table. 



## Usability Implications

To ensure everything worked as intended I tested and altered everything on my webpage. This included adding pieces and glazes to the database as well as removing them and adding layers to pieces. 


## Functionality Implications

To make my webpage easy to navigate for my end user, I got feedback about the layout from them. For example, my end user suggested a more simplistic design for viewing completed glazes. 


## Aesthetic Implications 

To make sure I used colours that work well together, I went to pico.css and found the page about colours, from there i found a colour scheme I liked. To make sure my font was an appropriate size, I asked for feedback from my end-user.  


## Accessibility Implications

My intended end-user needs glasses to read, because of this I made sure to use a font size that isn't too small. With other potential end-users in mind I made sure to put alt text on all my form fill in spaces.

## Overall Review

The overall concept transferred into a webpage well, I only needed to change a few things to align better with usability. I ran into a couple of problems trying to add layers and time-stamps to pieces, however I worked around this problem and adapted to it (this is the change i talked about earlier). After testing adding layers to pieces, I found issues adding them as a total like I intended, this led to them being displayed as separate entries. Overall, I think it went well so i'm not sure what I would do different if I could, however finding a solution to the problem mentioned earlier would have been nice.
