# Project Review

## Addressing Relevant Implications

## End-User Requirements


To be able to track how many layers have been completed as well as glazes and pieces I made two forms to add glazes and pieces to the database. Then you can find a piece on the home screen and then add a glaze layer to the table. 



## Usability Implications

To make my webpage easy to navigate for my end user, I got feedback about the layout from them. For example, my end user suggested a more simplistic design for viewing completed glazes. 


## Functionality Implications

Functionality implications refer to how particular features effect the overall usefulness and effectiveness on the system.  

### Relevance to the System

Functionality implications will help my end user use my website to fulfil its intended purpose without getting confused or having overcomplicated steps to achieve something.

### Impact / Considerations

To use Functionality implications across my website i need to consider how my end user will want to navigate the website and interact with my DB

## Overall Review

Replace these words with a brief review of how the project went in terms of:
- What went well?
- What didn't go so well?
- How did the testing/trialling impact the final system?
- What would you do differently if you could?
The overall concept transfered into a website well, I only needed to change a few things to align better with usability.
